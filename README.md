#Flower Type Prediction
##Overview
This project involves predicting the type of flower based on various features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. We have implemented three different machine learning models for this task:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the well-known Iris dataset. It contains 150 samples with four features each and three different flower types:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

##Models
1. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a linear model for binary classification. It applies the logistic function to a linear combination of the input features to predict the probability of a certain class.

2. Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.

##Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
You can find the detailed evaluation results and comparison in the Jupyter Notebook.
